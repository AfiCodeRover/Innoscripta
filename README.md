# üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Laravel News Crawler API is a web application that crawls and aggregates news articles from various sources, such as NewsAPI, Guardian API, and Mediastack API, and stores them in a database. It provides a RESTful API to access the news data.

# üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

There is two options for installing this app:

  - [By Laravel Sail](#by_sail)

  - [Without Laravel Sail](#without_sail)

### Sail alias

To add the ./vendor/bin/sail directory to your bash environment, you can modify your shell configuration file. If you're using Bash, it's likely that you have a .bashrc or .bash_profile file in your home directory. Here's how you can add the ./vendor/bin/sail directory to your PATH:

 1. Open your shell configuration file in a text editor. Use one of the following commands based on your shell:

```
nano ~/.bashrc
```
2. Add the following line at the end of the file:
```
alias sail='bash ./vendor/bin/sail'
```
 3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

 4. To apply the changes immediately, you can either restart your terminal or run the following command:

 ```
 source ~/.bashrc   # for Bash
 ```

Now, you should be able to use sail commands from anywhere in your terminal.
